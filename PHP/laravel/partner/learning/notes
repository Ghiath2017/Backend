How can I use hash ?

First include the Facade in your file
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash;
use Hash;

and use Make Method to generate password.
$hashedPassword = Hash::make($request->newPassword);

and when you want to match the Hashed string you can use the below code:
Hash::check($request->newPasswordAtLogin, $hashedPassword)
